# Blooming Chrysanthemum Animation

A procedural animation of a chrysanthemum flower blooming, created using Python's **Turtle** graphics library.

Description
This project simulates the natural blooming process of a flower. It uses mathematical functions to control the position, rotation, and size of the petals, creating a smooth opening and closing animation loop.

The code features:
- **Gradient Coloring:** Uses a custom palette ranging from deep burgundy to soft pink.
- **Dynamic Geometry:** Petals are drawn using a custom lens-shape algorithm rather than standard circles.
- **Smooth Animation:** Utilizes `turtle.tracer(0)` for frame-by-frame rendering.
